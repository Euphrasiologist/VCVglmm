Description: A bunch of functions that I have found useful in creating and have gotten help from many sources. Useful only really for MCMCglmm model output, which are generalised linear mixed effects models in a bayesian framework, and lme4, the standard (and great!) frequentist solution to mixed models.
Depends: R(>= 3.5.1); library(data.table); library(ggplot2); library(lattice); library(tidyverse)
